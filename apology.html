   <p>You may have recently received a "<span class='first'></span>" notification for a product that was, in fact, not <span class='second'></span>. Our bad. We've been having ongoing technical problems with our stock notifications — our <span class='third'></span> is on the case — but sadly no <span class='fourth'></span> was involved, so we can't even blame that for our mistake.

    We ask for <span class='fifth'></span> using <span class='sixth'></span>, because apologies with a dollar sign attached are always better.
    
    Thank you for sticking with us, even when our <span class='seventh'></span> are <span class='eigth'></span>.</p>
