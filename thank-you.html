   <p>Thanks for helping us reach a huge milestone! It’s hard to describe how <span class='first'></span> we are. On October 9th last year the very first photo was uploaded to tookapic.

    We <span class='second'></span> a little page to celebrate our first 365 days. We made it! We’re <span class='third'></span>. We’re thankful. We’re motivated! We want to thank you all for <span class='fourth'></span> with us.
    
    Want to give us a birthday present?
    
    The best present we can get from you today is <span class='fifth'></span>. Help us spread the word about this <span class='sixth'></span> day.
    
    Anyway, this is just the beginning. We have new and amazing stuff coming soon including brand new tookapic shop and photo books. Stay tuned.
    
    See you tomorrow!</p>
